  "description": "Package updates are available for Alibaba Cloud Linux 3 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2025-13601:\nA heap-based buffer overflow problem was found in glib through an incorrect calculation of buffer size in the g_escape_uri_string() function. If the string to escape contains a very large number of unacceptable characters (which would need escaping), the calculation of the length of the escaped string could overflow, leading to a potential write off the end of the newly allocated string.",
