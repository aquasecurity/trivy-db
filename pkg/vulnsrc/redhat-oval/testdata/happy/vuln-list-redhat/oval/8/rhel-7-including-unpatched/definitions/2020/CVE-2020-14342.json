    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in cifs-utils' mount.cifs where it was invoking a shell when requesting the Samba password, which could be used to inject arbitrary commands. This flaw allows an attacker who can invoke mount.cifs with special permission, such as via sudo rules, to escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker would need to be able to inject a specially crafted username into the command run by root. This requires a specific setup (e.g.: sudo rules, etc.).\nAs a result, the vulnerability is considered as low severity.",
